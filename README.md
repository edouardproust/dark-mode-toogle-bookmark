# dark-mode-toogle-bookmark
Toggle Dark / Light mode for any website directly clicking on a Bookmark. This is the most reliable code for applying Dark mode on Github as it inverts colors of the page instead of changing backgrounds and font colors.

- Works perfectly for Google products (Calendar, Docs, Sheet, Ads, Analytics, Tag Manager), Facebook, Instagram, etc. 
- Works on any browser.
